Hello Debezium Community! 

I am Alvar Viana and exactly one month ago I joined Red Hat and the Debezium team. I am a software engineer with almost 10 years of professional experience.
In my career, I have always worked for product companies/projects. 
Started as backend/embedded developer for a company that was acquired ABB.
A few years later I changed my life, cities, jobs and  roles. Since then, I worked at adidas and Sysdig as a Quality Engineer. 
As of today, I am happily joining Red Hat and Debezium.  

I've had limited contact with Red Hat, although since I was a child, I have admired the company; since half a year ago, I have been in different selection processes.
I have previously worked with Debezium to create a PoC to keep two databases synchronized. Unfortunately, that effort never moved beyond a poC, but that experience and knowledge will now be useful.

So, here I am! Willing to learn as much as possible about Kafka, Kafka Connect, multiple databases and, especially, about Debezium. 
Over time, I hope to be able to do my bit and improve the quality with which we deliver Debezium: increase the quality, improve the process, reduce building and testing time, etc. 

Really nice to meet you and to be able to help. Alvar.
